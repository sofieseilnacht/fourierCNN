# fourierCNN
A convolutional neural network in the Fourier space using linear regression to predict galactic ellipticity values and Large Scale Structure shear.
Contains a copy of Dr. Ian Harrison's rwl_sims GitHub repository that creates simulations of galaxies (and LSS) with varying levels of ellipticities (and/or shears).
